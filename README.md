### Describe the different data analysis architectures.
The data architecture is a fundamental element for the information management and business organization systems to be successful.
It integrates the models, policies and rules that govern what data is to be collected; how they will be stored, classified and exploited through the available technological infrastructure.
In the same way that data architecture is critical to the good management of a company, so is its corporate strategy, so it is necessary to take care of its design and implementation. The two are related, since if something fails in the design of the corporate strategy, there may be many failures in data management and, consequently, in the organization of the company. A migration process, for example, can become a real headache if the database design presents problems.
An example of a well-defined data architecture are those companies that, after learning about the changes to be applied to the RGPD, adapted their databases before the regulation came into force.
Costs reduction
The most powerful and potential data technologies, such as the Hadoop system and cloud-based analytics, must be brought into use. These generate a cost advantage, since when it comes to storing large amounts of data, there is a large amount of supply that shows exponential growth in the following years, also allowing us to identify more efficient ways of marketing.
Faster decision making
Referring to the Hadoop system, its speed and information analytics, combined with the ability to analyze new data sources, serve companies to have information immediately (either as a summary or as specific data that is required ) and in this way make decisions based on what they have learned (artificial intelligence).
Generate new products / services
Big Data offers the ability to analyze and measure customer needs, therefore, their satisfaction is given through the analysis of their information, with which it is possible to know with certainty what they want or need. Through analytics, companies create new products and services to meet the demands of their customers. They can even generate new needs that they did not know they had.
Identify the characteristics of a data center.
1. Security: Data is the fundamental support of any business model in the modern era, so ensuring information security is one of the main priorities of companies. On the one hand, it is necessary to take into account the protection measures that will be implemented in the physical environment. In this sense, the access control measures (identification cards, biometrics, etc.) stand out so that only authorized personnel can contact the data center. On the other hand, it is essential to have protection tools such as data encryption. , either by hardware or by software, as well as security solutions against the loss of information and / or corruption in power failures.
